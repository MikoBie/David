The idea is to take a sample of people and measure their complexity with different measures. Compare if they will socre on all scales or there will be people who score only on one or two.

## Getting tweets

The idea is to validate hypothesis that people who follow only either CNN or FOX are less complex the ones who follow both sources. First thing first. Download some tweets.

```{r sources}

                               retryonratelimit = TRUE)

print("Sleeping after CNN followers. Do not wake up!")

## Sample of 15000 Fox News followers, it's maximum, however there is retryonratelimit argument

## Complexity of sources



## Emotional Complexity

## Complexity within one category

```{r category}

## Complexity of locations

```{r locations}
